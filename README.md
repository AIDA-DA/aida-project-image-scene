# aida-project-image-scene
We will build an image classifier, using the Intel Image Classificaion dataset. The dataset contains 25k images of the 6 categories. Our goal is to develop an algorithm which can distinguish the different image categories. I this approach I will use Tensorflow Keras together with pretained models provided by the framework.
